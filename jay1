i will be the best!
I will always do my best to surpass my performance!


We all wanna be the best versions of ourselves, but are we really willing to pay the price. Remember, no pain = no gain.
(Rapha)

So long the price is payable, i will sacrifice whatever it takes to always get better than my best.(Emmanuel)
